          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p> I love video games, yes very generic, but I really love open world adventure games,
            like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Programmers put so much detail into every little animal and tree, and every movement that a character makes is so fluid and real. I'm actually working on my own small game, a visual novel.
             It's not finished yet, but I really like the freedom of working on it.
