          <h2>Interests</h2>
          <p> I love video games. Yes, I know, very obvious and cliche, but I really love open world adventure games,
            like Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Programmers put so much detail into every little animal and tree, and every movement that a character makes is so fluid and real.
            I hope I can work on a game like it someday.</p>

            <p> I also love to read, which helps me come up with lots of ideas for games.
              Visual novels are a genre of games that I think would be fun to make, since I can write my own story and own characters as if they were in a real book.</p>
